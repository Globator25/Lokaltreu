# Changesets

This directory was generated by `changeset init` and holds release metadata for the Lokaltreu workspace.

- Run `npx changeset` to create a new entry when a change needs to be published.
- Do **not** edit files inside `.changeset` manually unless you know what you are doing.
- Releases are produced via the CI workflow once the accumulated changesets are versioned.
